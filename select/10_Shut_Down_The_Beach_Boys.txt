Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

It happened on the strip where the road is wide
(Ooo, rev it up now)
Two cool shorts standin' side by side
(Ooo, rev it up now)
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
(Ooo, rev it up now)
A revin' up our engines and it sounds real mean
(Ooo, rev it up now)

Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

Declinin' numbers at an even rate
(Ooo, movin' out now)
At the count of one we both accelerate
(Ooo, movin' out now)
My stingray is light the slicks are startin' to spin
(Ooo, movin' out now)
But the four-thirteen's really diggin' in
(Ooo, movin' out now)

Gotta be cool now
Power shift here we go

Superstock dodge is windin' out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really startin' to go
To get the traction I'm ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin,' that machine's too much

Pedal's to the floor, hear the dual quads drink
(Ooo, pump it up now)
And now the four-thirteen's lead is startin' to shrink
(Ooo, pump it up now)
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
(Ooo, pump it up now)
I got a fuel injected engine sittin' under my hood
(Ooo, pump it up now)

Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down

Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down

Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down

Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down

Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
