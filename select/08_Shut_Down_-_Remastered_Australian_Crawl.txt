Step alive my friend take cover
Be sure, beware of this other lover
She's cool, she's you, She's oh so shrewd and she's on to you
Steady yet, think clearly, be ready
Sometimes yr heart be unsteady
She's on time, She's outta line
This push and shove got a hurtful mind

Shut down, shut down, you should shut down on her, hey-ey-ey-ey
Shut down, shut down, close enough so walk away-ay-ay-ay

The girl has guts from top to toe
A vip's are spending money on this, no
A slim waist, it's good taste
The girl gets slow, but she'll up the pace
You're addicted to the swing jet set
It'll make her summer her best bet
Look sharp, play the part
Think with your mind and not your heart

Shut down, shut down, you should shut down on her, hey-ey-ey-ey
Shut down, shut down, close enough so walk away-ay, Walk away

Love is easy, love's so unkind
Some are sleezy, love's so blind
Her blue eyes, her bust size
She's done her homework and I'm not surprised
Step alive my friend take cover
Beware, be sure of this other lover
She's on time, She's outta line
This push and shove got a hurtful mind

Shut down, shut down, you should shut down on her, hey-ey-ey-ey
Shut down, shut down, close enough so walk away-ay-ay-ay
One hour (one hour), one day (one day), some how (some how), some way
Shut down, shut down, so close it up and save your alimony

Hey, your alimony, (I said) your alimony, (Hey) your alimony
Save it (your alimony, your alimony, (Hey) your alimony, your alimony)
(Alimony, alimony, alimony, alimony, alimony, alimony
